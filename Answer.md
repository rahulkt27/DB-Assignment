Question number 1 answer = Based on the provided schema, it seems like there is a relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities through the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. This suggests that each product in the "Product" table is associated with a specific category identified by its "category_id". This implies a one-to-many relationship, where one product can belong to only one category, but each category can have multiple products associated with it.

Question number 2 answer = 
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can use a foreign key constraint. Here's how you could implement it:

Add a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, referencing the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table.
This constraint will enforce referential integrity, ensuring that each value in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table matches a valid "id" value in the "Product_Category" table.
ALTER TABLE Product
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_category
FOREIGN KEY (category_id)
REFERENCES Product_Category(id);
